// `match` is a valid method for handling `Option`. However, you may
// eventually find heavy usage tedious, especially with operations only 
// valid with an input. In these cases, combinators can be used to 
// manage control flow in a modular fashion.
// 
// `Option` has a buil in method called `map()`, a vombinator for the simple
// mapping of `Some -> Some` and `None -> None`. Multiple `map()` calls can
// be chained together for even more flexibility.
//
// In the following example, `process()` replaces all functions previous
// to it while staying compact
